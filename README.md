# Imagine Dungeons: A platform for developing 3D dungeon games with an architecture that allows for the training of intelligent agents to play the game.


# Description

Imagine Dungeons is a web-based platform focused on AI students trying to explore the training of AI agents that play games. The tool allows the users to create an account and easily create a 3D dungeon game using pre-defined assets and structure for a dungeon game. It is not required any coding related to developing the game. It was developed using three.js, and the game runs in the browser. I created a custom environment on OpenAi Gym, so you can train the agent using a well know reinforcement learning architecture.
